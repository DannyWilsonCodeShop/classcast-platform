# YouTube Video Submission Guide

## How to Submit YouTube Videos for Assignments

### Step 1: Upload Your Video to YouTube
1. Go to [YouTube Studio](https://studio.youtube.com)
2. Click "Create" → "Upload videos"
3. Select your video file
4. Add a title and description

### Step 2: Set Video Privacy
Choose one of these options:
- **Public**: Anyone can find and watch your video
- **Unlisted**: Only people with the link can watch (recommended for class assignments)
- ❌ **Private**: Only you can watch (won't work for assignments)

### Step 3: Enable Embedding (IMPORTANT!)
This is the most commonly missed step:

1. In YouTube Studio, go to your video
2. Click "Details" or "Edit"
3. Scroll down to "Advanced settings" or click "Show more"
4. Find the checkbox that says **"Allow embedding"**
5. ✅ **Make sure this box is CHECKED**
6. Click "Save"

### Step 4: Get Your Video Link
1. Click "Share" under your video
2. Copy the link (it will look like `https://youtu.be/XXXXXXXXXXX`)
3. Paste this link into your assignment submission

## Common Issues

### "Video shows as private" or "Embedding disabled"
**Cause**: The "Allow embedding" checkbox is not checked

**Solution**:
1. Go to your video in YouTube Studio
2. Edit → Advanced settings
3. Check "Allow embedding"
4. Save changes
5. Resubmit your assignment (or ask your instructor to refresh)

### "Video not found"
**Cause**: Video is set to Private or has been deleted

**Solution**:
- Change privacy to Public or Unlisted
- Make sure the video finished processing on YouTube

### "Invalid YouTube URL"
**Cause**: The link format is incorrect

**Solution**:
- Use the link from YouTube's "Share" button
- Valid formats:
  - ✅ `https://youtu.be/XXXXXXXXXXX`
  - ✅ `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXXXXXXXXXX`
  - ❌ `youtube.com` (incomplete)
  - ❌ Channel or playlist links

## Alternative Options

If you prefer not to use YouTube or have issues with embedding:

### Option 1: Direct Upload
- Upload your video file directly (recommended for privacy)
- Maximum file size: 500MB
- Supported formats: MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM

### Option 2: Google Drive
1. Upload video to Google Drive
2. Right-click → "Get link"
3. Set sharing to "Anyone with the link can view"
4. Copy and paste the link

## Quick Checklist

Before submitting a YouTube video:
- [ ] Video is uploaded and finished processing
- [ ] Privacy is set to Public or Unlisted (not Private)
- [ ] "Allow embedding" is checked in Advanced settings
- [ ] You've tested the link by pasting it in a new browser tab
- [ ] The link is from the "Share" button (not the address bar)

## Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Try using direct upload instead of YouTube
2. Contact your instructor with:
   - Your video link
   - A screenshot of your YouTube privacy settings
   - A screenshot of your Advanced settings showing "Allow embedding"

**Pro Tip**: If you want to keep your video private but still submit it for class, use "Unlisted" privacy with embedding enabled. This way, only people with the link (your instructor) can watch it, but it will still work in the grading system.
